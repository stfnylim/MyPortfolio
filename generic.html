								and the game was no longer possible to proceed.
								After many hours of research, I still couldn't figure out why the code wouldn't work, but I was able to try to critically think was wrong
							with my project. I tried to make sure I was checking both the distance and time for the enemy spawner and it finally was able to work properly again. </p>
